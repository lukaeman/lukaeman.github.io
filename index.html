Ideal Job:

The Position:
This job posting is for a position as a repair technician for the company “Ozzie Geeks”. This is an at-home computer repair company that specialises in same day repair of computer systems in homes and businesses around Brisbane and Perth. This job is appealing to me as I like working with and repairing computers, so not only am I interested in the work, but I have prior knowledge.
Skills Required:
As stated on the application I must be able to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve a customer’s issue. To do this I imagine I’d need a sound grasp on the common issues and their solutions of the systems that this company repairs, which include but are not limited to HP, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, etc.
My Skills:
I’m already fairly knowledgeable in working with and repairing windows systems from my years of hobby level computer building and repairing. I also have prior training in repairing systems on-site and communicating with the customer in person from my prior job at an AV company as a repair technician.
Increasing my knowledge:
To build upon the skills I already have I would like to learn more about servicing and repairing Apple devices. While the internals of their devices are relatively easy to deal with, it is my understanding that they make the devices harder to get into (aside from professional grade products such as the Mac Pro).

Project Idea:
Overview (100 words):
My project idea for this assignment is an online help platform dedicated to educating people on servicing and repairing their own technology. The main idea behind this platform is that questions or common issues would be posted to the website, and a specialist in that area would respond to the support ticket with a tutorial on how to solve the problem. These tutorials would be voted for by other users to sort out the most helpful and easy to understand, similar to platforms such as Quora and Stack Overflow.
Motivation (100 words):
Much likes platforms such as Quora, Stack Overflow, and Yahoo Answers the main focus of this platform would to be make information easy to access, hopefully increasing the amount of people that learn how to service and repair their own systems. Ultimately this platform aims to increase the growing number of people who feel comfortable using a computer and are able to resolve and issue when one inevitably occurs. There is already a demand for a platform dedicated to resolving issues with computers, as is evident by the various groups on Quora and the large number of forum posts on sites such as LTT Forums.


Description (500 Words):
To facilitate the verification of information the platform would have several different portals and account types, those are as follows:
Verified Users:
These users would have to go through a verification process to get an icon similar to a “blue tick” from twitter. Once a user is verified they gain no additional control over the platform, but it does give them a higher standing in the community as their verification shows other users that the user has a professional background in the areas they post in frequently.
To get verified a user would have to send in ID to verify their profile, as well as some proof of their education/professional experience, whether that be a degree from a university or a reference/proof of a job in the industry
Standard Users:
A standard user has all the same access to the site as a verified user, the only main difference being the “verified” status. A standard user can post questions as well as answers to questions.
To become a standard user, you would need to either create an account on the site or sign in using an existing account/google account.
Guest Users:
A guest user is someone browsing the site without being logged into an account. A guest user has the ability to view all questions and answers, but cannot vote on correct answers, post questions/answers, or save questions/answers to their account.
Description (500 words):
There are three different ways a user may approach using the platform; to ask a question, to answer a question, to find an answer to a question. All three of these approaches may have slightly different paths depending on the users account status. Below are the different ways a user may approach using the site and the experience they will have:
Asking a question:
As a verified user:
The user will post their question and it will eventually have answers from other users. The question will also state that its coming from a verified user (no function, just aesthetic).
As a standard user:
The user will post their question and it will eventually have answers from other users.
As a guest user:
The user will get a pop-up after pressing the “submit” button prompting them to sign in to post their question. If they sign in/create an account their post will go through, however if they do not sign in their post will not go through.
Answering a question:
As a verified question:
If a verified user answers a question their answer will be placed at the top of the answer section to allow users to easily see their answer. Their answer will have a verified symbol on it (no function, just aesthetic).
As a standard user:
If a standard user answers a question their answer will be placed in the answer section with the order being oldest to newest from top to bottom (first answer at top, last answer at bottom).
As a guest user:
If a guest user answers a question they will be prompted to sign in after pressing the “submit” button. If they sign in/create an account their answer will be posted, however if they neglect to sign in their answer will not be posted.
Finding an answer to an already asked question:
As a verified user:
If a verified user finds an answer that worked, they can upvote the answer, leading to it being promoted as an answer to the question. If the user found the answer did not work/was not helpful they can downvote it, leading to it being placed lower on the answers list or possibly being removed if it gets reported/downvoted too much.
As a standard user:
If a standard user finds an answer that worked, they can upvote the answer, leading to it being promoted as an answer to the question. If the user found the answer did not work/was not helpful they can downvote it, leading to it being placed lower on the answers list or possibly being removed if it gets reported/downvoted too much.
As a guest user:
If a guest user finds an answer that worked/didn’t work, they cannon upvote/downvote it. If they try to upvote/downvote the answer they will be prompted to sign in. if they sign in/create and account their vote will be counted, but if they neglect to sign in their vote will not go through.
Front Page Mechanics:
Question/Answer promotion:
The front page of the platform would have several mechanics to allow users on the front page to find the currently trending questions and answers. The front page would promote questions that are have are receiving the most answers/votes, as well as promoting questions and answers form verified users.
Revenue from advertisements:
Just like similar platforms such as Quora, the site would make the income to run the site from advertisements. To ensure that the advertisements aren’t intrusive or distasteful they site would partner with an advertisement company to ensure that the ads are suitable for the user base of the site, as well as making sure they don’t flash bright colours, play sounds, redirect to dangerous sites, etc.


Tools and Technologies:
Most of the tools needed to develop the platform are cheap on a small scale, but further investigation would be required to determine the cost of technology such as a database to store user details and site posts. To develop the site a program such as Adobe Dreamweaver ($20USD per month) or Webflow ($35USD per month). On a small-scale webhosting costs anywhere from $1 to $10 a month, however due to the high expected traffic hosting may cost more. Webhosting through a service such as “hostpapa.com.au” quotes professional level hosting at roughly $15 a month.
Skills Required:
To successfully create a Q&A site the skills required are:
-	Database management
-	Web security
-	Web design
While I currently have the base knowledge required to build a website, I don’t have the education to successfully run a business or manage a website will thousands or more active members
Ultimately many of the tasks associated with running a business and functional website would have to be managed by someone with a formal education in the required skills, so whether I seek out the required education or hire someone who already knows what their doing would come do to a cost/rewards analysis.

Outcome:
Ultimately, I hope to have a fully functional website that aims to educate people rather than just answering their questions. On similar sites such as Stack Overflow most questions just get answered without an explanation, whereas on this site the answers would aim to educate the user who posted the question. I don’t have any experience with building a professional website or running a business so more than anything it’s a passion project.
